# Federated-Learning-Solidity-Contract
This repository contains code for a federated learning smart contract implemented in Solidity. Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach where multiple participants collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. Instead, they share model updates, which are aggregated to create a global model. This smart contract facilitates the registration of nodes, data sharing, model update submission, and model aggregation.

Prerequisites
To run this code, you need the following dependencies:

Python (3.6 or above)
solcx library (Solidity compiler)
torch library (for model training)
sklearn library (for dataset and machine learning models)
web3 library (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)
numpy library (for data manipulation)
struct library (for packing model updates)
joblib library (for model persistence)
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Revanthraja/Federated-Learning-Solidity-Contract.git
Install the required Python libraries:
Copy code
pip install solcx torch scikit-learn web3 numpy joblib
Modify the Solidity code (solidity_code variable) if necessary.

Update the Ganache URL (ganache_url variable) to connect to your Ethereum test network.

Run the code:

Copy code
python dectree.py
Code Explanation
Step 1: Compile the Solidity code: The Solidity code is compiled using the solcx library, and the contract ABI and bytecode are extracted.

Step 2: Deploy the Smart Contract: The compiled contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain using web3 library. The contract address is obtained after the deployment.

Step 3: Use the deployed contract for training: An instance of the deployed contract is created using the contract address.

Step 4: Node Registration: A training node registers itself by calling the registerNode function of the smart contract.

Step 6: Data Distribution: Data is distributed to the nodes by calling the shareData function of the smart contract. Each node receives a portion of the data based on its address.

Step 8: Model Update: Each node trains a local model using its assigned data and submits the model update to the smart contract by calling the submitModelUpdate function.

Step 8: Model Aggregation: The smart contract aggregates the model updates received from the nodes and creates an aggregated model by calling the aggregateModelUpdates function.

Step 9: Save the trained model: The trained model is saved to a file using the joblib library.

Step 10: Calculate and print the accuracy: The accuracy of the trained model is calculated and printed.
